Learn Apollo, GraphQL, React and styled-components in a single chat app! 
But wait... There's more:
- GraphQL Subscriptions with Apollo
- Authentication in Graphcool and Apollo with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- Handle login and logout with [Auth0 Lock](https://auth0.com/lock)
- Graphcool for BaaS 
- ...

*This project does not offer fancy styling, Sorry... but I wanted to focus on new stuff not what I already know (Fancy Styling)!*

## Why?
I didn't have much experience with Apollo, Subscriptions and authentication with GraphQL and Auth0, so I decided to make an app and experiment with all of these at once! I added each functionality one at a time. I believe with this method, you can learn anything nicely without losing the focus. In my YouTube videos I teach with this method too.
